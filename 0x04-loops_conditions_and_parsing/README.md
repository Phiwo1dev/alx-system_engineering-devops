In this project I used Shellcheck to write Bash scripts and also learned:

-How to create SSH keys
-What is the advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
-How to use while, until and for loops
-How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
-How to use the cut command
-What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them
