Duration: 13 March 2019 (24 hours)
Impact: Global outage of Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and others in the Facebook family of apps, affecting billions of users. Users were unable to access the platforms, and to communicate through the services.

Timeline:

Detection Time: March 13, 2019, 11:00 AM ET (Eastern Time)
Detection Method: Reports flooded in from users worldwide who were experiencing difficulties accessing Facebook-owned platforms
Actions Taken:
Engaged with internal monitoring systems, which confirmed a widespread service disruption.
An internal investigation into the root causewas initiated.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The outage was caused by a server configuration change that triggered a cascading series of issues.
A routine maintenance task involving the adjustment of server settings had an unintended and severe impact on the entire infrastructure.
Resolution:
Reverted the server configuration change to the previous state.
Conducted extensive testing to ensure the stability of the systems.
Implemented additional safeguards to prevent similar issues in the future, including more stringent change management procedures.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:

Enhanced communication protocols for rapid response to global outages.
Implemented more comprehensive testing environments to simulate and identify potential issues before changes are applied.
Increased redundancy and failover mechanisms to mitigate the impact of unforeseen configuration changes.

Tasks to Address the Issue:
Conduct a thorough review of change management processes to prevent accidental configuration changes.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly identify and respond to global service disruptions.
Develop and implement more robust testing procedures for server configurations before deployment.
Provide additional training for operations teams on the potential impact of configuration changes and the importance of thorough testing.

Postmortem Conclusion: The March 2019 outage, which occurred at 3:00 PM UTC, was a result of a routine server configuration change gone awry. The unintended impact led to a global disruption of Facebook-owned services, causing inconvenience for billions of users. Swift detection and a coordinated response were crucial in resolving the issue within 24 hours.

To address the incident, immediate actions involved rolling back the configuration change and ensuring system stability through rigorous testing. The postmortem analysis highlighted the need for improvements in change management processes, testing procedures, and communication protocols during global outages.

Corrective measures focused on preventing similar incidents in the future. This included enhancing testing environments, implementing additional safeguards, and providing further training for operations teams. The lessons learned from this outage have since contributed to Facebook's ongoing efforts to maintain the reliability and availability of its services for users worldwide in a professional and transparent manner.
